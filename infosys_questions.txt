9. You are given a file containing space seperated words, your job is to find the most trending word in a file.

10. Write a program of printing the nth number in fibonacci series.         (logn -> use matrix exponentiation)

11. Explain the working of Merge Sort.

12. You are given a sequence of numbers your job is to find frequency of each element in single traversal (approach of using hashmap).

    given a 2gb file and an extra 1gb memory, use this 1gb memory to sort the entire 2gb file (use merge-sort -> merge procedure keeping max chunk size as 1gb)

13. Suppose you are given two arrays, you have to merge them in sorted order.

14. Generate substrings of string.

15. Find the lexicographically next permutation of a given string.

16. Write a program that checks whether a string is palindromic in nature.

17. Given an integer, print the next smallest palindrome.

18. Find the prime factors of a number [use : Sieve of Eratosthenes]
